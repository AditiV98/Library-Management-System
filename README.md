# Library-Management-System
In this project I have used ReactJS concepts like react-router and hooks to create components like addBooks, ManageBooks and delete.
For styling and designing of the SPA I have used MaterialUI.
For storing the data I have used JSON document and for fetching data from JSON file I have used Axios Library.



# Commands to run the project
npm install
cd book
npm start

# For running db.json 
json-server db.json --p 4000
